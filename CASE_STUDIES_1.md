##Summary
Auto-Suggest-Top-Results - The Joy of Use Search: We will show you a strikingly easy concept, that outreaches the expectations of the users without great effort. Based on the existing search, exactly what the user needs the most, actually happens. And if the site operator is smart enough, it also shows what they want the user to see. We will look at the basic idea, the concept and live-examples. Last but not least you will get to know about the benefits of the combination of TYPO3 and Owncloud. Sven Ditz

Visit Sweden: A pilot project with Visit Sweden, using aQlue, where the focus was to increase return of the partner investments, expand upon co-marketing and save time. Robert Lind and Annelie Näs
