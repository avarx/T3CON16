##Summary
We all love TYPO3 as a flexible and a high-capacity system. The wide range of possibilities is known and there is hardly anything that cannot be done. But also TYPO3 has to adapt to our rapidly changing world and respond flexibly to the various requirements of the present time. The TYPO3 Community and especially the core team has accordingly understood the rapid pace of development, obviously shown in the start of version 7, that is closer on market requirements as ever before. Whether cloud ability, responsive backend or implementation of doctrine. All areas of the system will be developed and optimized relevant to the market.

We offer this product workshop to support this trend and to offer a platform to actively participate in research and topic search - especially for you as user and operator. Together with members of the core team and the TYPO3 GmbH, topics that could be important for continuous development of TYPO3 and further product planning will be collected and developed.

The target
group of the workshop consists of technical leaders, project managers,
accontants and visionaries, who will involve customers requirements to make
TYPO3 even more attractive.
