##Summary
Create content without instant publishing. A common challenge. So we had a look at all existing solutions and found out that others also need a new way of publishing. But we had to build it from scratch – and maintain it for years! There were technical uncertainties and one question: Who pays for it? This talk shares our experience with a new way of funding off the beaten track.
