##Summary
The next big project comes with complex requirements. You may need a content management system. But you will also need a search engine, commerce solution, dynamic API, data migration, apps, SEO, analytics, conversion tracking, testing, monitoring, social media connectivity and many more features which are all not covered out of the box by an open source CMS like TYPO3. Creating a performance solution stack will save you a lot of time selecting the right tools, buying software and connecting all these systems together around TYPO3.
