##Summary
The CMS has had its ups and downs in the last decades and today, it's stronger than ever, fitting the needs for both enterprise and smaller web projects. The next LTS version, planned for April 2017, is a evolutionary step in the right direction, but the works in the last years are just the beginning. Benni Mack and Mathias Schreiber will take you to a trip in the future, and where TYPO3 will set new standards within web content management.
