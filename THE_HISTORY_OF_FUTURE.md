##Summary
In his presentation, Erik H채ndeler is considering success patterns determining productivity and prosperity of society. The current focus is on efficient use of knowledge. Individuals are not able anymore to maintain an overview of the quantity of information and are reliant on information forwarded by others. Dealing knowledge productively requires cooperation at eye level, transparency, willingness to compromise with others, ability to cooperate, long-term plans and authenticity instead of focusing on status.
