##Summary
Good tests are indispensable for improvement â€“ bad split-run tests can do serious harm.

In this talk we will present the concept of A/B tests, do some maths & have a look behind the scenes of past A/B tests. We will share our findings, explain how to identify & avoid potential pitfalls and how thoroughly planned tests can radically increase the pace of innovation.
