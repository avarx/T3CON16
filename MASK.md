##Summary
Mask is an extension for templating, close to the TYPO3 core. It manages pagetemplates, extends them with new fields, creates specific contentelements, designs the frontend with fluid and much more. Content is stored directly into the database, not in flexforms. It is possible to access the content with TypoScript, SQL or directly with Fluid.
