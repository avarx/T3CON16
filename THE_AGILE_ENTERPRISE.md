##Summary
The buzzword "digital transformation" is all the rage and will trigger the largest industrial revolution since more than a century for sure. But what does this mean in concrete terms? How will the change look like that companies have to fulfill? We will not only have a look at the 10 dimensions of the "Digital Maturity Level Model", which indicates how mature a company is in terms of the „digital age“ but on concrete practical oriented methods and processes of the digital transformation like Scrum, Kanban, Design Thinking, Lean Startup, LEGO SERIOUS PLAY, OKR and many more as well. At the end of the transformation there is a new, converted corporate form - the agile enterprise.
