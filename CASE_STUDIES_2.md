##Summary
Our speakers show you interesting case studies, such as: Xhale: The case is about a ‚Stop smoking‘ tool or application on TYPO3 with integration to a light app. Swiss International Airlines: First their internal communication was based on a printed newsletter. The speakers will take you on the digital transformation journey to te web- and app-based communication on the foundation of TYPO3. Within twelve months DFAU and FIT Reisen, the leading specialist for health and wellness travel, relaunched their nine international sites. We approached the project by "Engineering First" and thus had the approach looking for new technologies rather than using established solutions – which also made us fall in love with web-components.
