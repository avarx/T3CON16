##Summary
After a few years of abstinence from the project, I am looking back at what is now history in amazement. Amazed about the resilience of it's spirit, especially given the amount and magnitude of mistakes I made (with little help from my friends). In my talk I would like to give a tour of the most bizarre errors and how TYPO3 not only survived , but thrived. Lessons learned hopefully included.
