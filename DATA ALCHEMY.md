##Summary
Main actor of this alchemic wonder will be a peculiar substance called "R". Some peasants describe "R" as "a software environment for statistical computing and graphics" – but they'll get burned at the stakes anyway…

Every company generates various kinds of data. Let it be accounting data, time records of employees, quality assurance sensor data … or anything else. Most of this data just exists and your company doesn't profit from it. I'd like to show you how to get started making more out of these hidden treasures using R.

We'll start with a very quick introduction to R. I will show you how R basically works, how it can be compared to Excel and why it will speed up your journey of transforming data into gold. Equipped with a basic understanding of R I will take you on an expedition to what you can do with R – especially in combination with several other open source tools. Two very interesting tools in combination with R are LaTeX and Freeboard. LaTeX allows you to generate beautiful looking reports based on your data. Freeboard is an open source dashboard software that can access and present data of various sources. By means of real world examples I will demonstrate you how different kinds of reports are created at dkd to support our team and management in their controlling tasks.

Having attended in this talk, I will guarantee you that your chances in creating gold from raw data will increase by at least 27%.
