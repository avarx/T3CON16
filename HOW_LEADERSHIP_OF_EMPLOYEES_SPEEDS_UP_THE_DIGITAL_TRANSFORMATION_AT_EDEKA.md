##Summary
The major players in the industry - such as Google, LinkedIn, Zalando, Red Bull, Oracle & Co. - demonstrate it. In modern enterprises, a modern and contemporary framework is used for personnel management - OKR (Objectives & Key Results). Are goal management and "New Work" opposites? OKR combines both! We explain the method and the framework in detail and show why it is so successful in times of digital transformation - even or especially at EDEKA.
