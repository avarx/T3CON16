##Summary
Let’s make great content! A cool idea for a click tool or a well written text are not enough. To fulfill its potential, content must be great in all aspects: it has to delight the user, be optimized for different devices and search engines and it has to reach the user at the moment where it is most useful to them. This is why a good content strategy already takes the distribution and technical challenges into account at the conception stage. In this talk we will discuss what makes content great and how to face the upcoming challenges in the ever-changing world of online marketing.
