##Summary
Datastorage becomes cheaper and cheaper over time and the size of all media is increasing rapidly. This begins on image sizes for retina displays, over 4k videos and there is no end to see on this evolution. That is why ownCloud with his speciality of synchonizing and managing big data has some experience with this way. We want to show you how big data trough the web via universal file access or the concept of File Chunking helping to handle those data. Together we will have a look how this is helping not just for synchronization and data storage, but for your  web project.
