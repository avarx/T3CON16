##Summary
Semantic technologies offer a wide range of benefits in an increasing number of application fields such as data management, business intelligence, machine learning etc.. However - likely due to their complexity and the ambiguous business value - semantics yet play a little role in SME applications. As e-commerce industry partner of the Linked Enterprise Data Services (LEDS) project, Netresearch identified concrete use cases for semantic technologies, that provide improved solutions for common business requirements like data integration, content creation, catalog management and search.
