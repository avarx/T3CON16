##Summary
The Agency Days mark the beginning of involving the members of TYPO3 Association more and more with the development processes of the TYPO3 Universe. 18 months ago, this led to the decision to work on TYPO3 Inc. Under the leadership of Alain Veuve, an international team of 10 members worked out a concept how such a company might look like and what could be the tasks. The result was unanimously accepted on the GA 6 months ago and the TYPO3 GmbH started working as an active participant in the market to put ideas into
practice.

To respect the wishes of the target group and involve partners, agencies and customers we offer a workshop concerning the working tasks of TYPO3 GmbH. The aim of the workshop is, to explain the responsibilities of the TYPO3 GmbH and to complete and optimize these with your input in an intensive working circle. Different topics as partner management, market positioning and market place should be examined in greater detail. Further ideas and possibilities should be developed. The result will be implemented by the GmbH in various fields to consider an even more intensive target groups feedback in daily work.

The target group consists of accountants, partner managers and marketing executives of agencies and end customers, who wish to use their expertise for common tasks of TYPO3 market development.
