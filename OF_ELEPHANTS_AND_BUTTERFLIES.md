##Summary
This is not a talk about animals! But it is a talk about how to address the elephant in the room! We all know situations, where all stakeholders are aware of a problem, but none wants to talk about it or even give it a name. But what if this problem wonÂ´t become an elephant but a beautiful butterfly? It is about the idea, that every problem is not there all of sudden, but goes through some kind of metamorphosis. And the unattractive caterpillar could turn into a big, heavy elephant as well as into a beautiful, light butterfly. This talk shows, that talking in an open and transparent way about upcoming problems right at the beginning helps to create a better time management, improves motivation and reduces misunderstandings and failures. Talking about a problem is the best way to find better and smarter solutions - your butterflies!
