##Summary
In 2014 we started restructuring a line-staff organization to an agile organic structure. This comes with a lot of change and new concepts. If you lose overview this might lead to chaos and you will have the urge to roll back all changes. I want to show how we guide and track change so that we enhance continuously as a group without losing control.
